If you come from a SQL background like I do. Sqldf allows you to 
query data in R.

<!--more-->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```




```{r warning=FALSE}

library(sqldf)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

## Introduction

Coming from a SQL background and being able to use SQL to do EDA was deinitely a help in R. Although with using packages such as dplyr you can do much the same thing.
Sqldf is another great tool in your arsenal.


## Some example commands

sqldf supports the SQLite database backend by default. To check the version run the below.

```{r}

sqldf("select sqlite_version()")


```




Get data

```{r warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}


#getwd()

crash <- read_csv("../../../static/data/crash_data.csv")




```

sqldf also enables reading in data using read.csv.sql :

crash <- read.csv.sql(file="data/crash.csv",sql="select * from file")




We can start of with a staight select where columns are selected and the data is filtered with the where clause.

```{r}

crash_data_2017 <-  sqldf("select Count_Unit_Motorcycle_Moped,Crash_Month,Crash_Severity from crash where Crash_Year = 2017" )
#display just a subset of rows
sqldf("select * from crash_data_2017 limit 10")
```

Next we can try an aggregate to and group by month.
AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM are all supported.


```{r}

crash_data_sum_month <- sqldf("select sum(Count_Unit_Motorcycle_Moped) as Num_Crashes,Crash_Month  from crash_data_2017 group by Crash_Month order by 1 DESC  "  )

crash_data_sum_month
```

Below we use a window function to create a running total.
For more info take a look at  : https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-window-functions/


```{r}

sqldf("select 
       Crash_Month
      ,Num_Crashes
      ,sum(Num_Crashes) OVER (
        ORDER BY Crash_Month  -- Note this is window ordering
        
        ) AS Running_Total
      from crash_data_sum_month ORDER by Crash_Month "  )

```

We can select the top 5 rows ordered by our sum of crashes descending


```{r}


sqldf("select * from crash_data_sum_month order by Num_crashes desc Limit 5") 


```


We can take a look at the distinct values

```{r}

sqldf("select distinct(crash_severity) from crash_data_2017" )


```


We can also concatenate values and cast them

```{r}

sqldf("select Crash_Month ||'-'|| cast(Crash_Year as text) from crash limit 10" )


```


We can also pipe our results out to other packages. In this case ggplot


```{r}

sqldf("select count(Crash_Severity) Count_Accidents, Crash_Severity from crash_data_2017 group by Crash_Severity ") %>% ggplot(aes(x=Crash_Severity,y=Count_Accidents)) + geom_col()


```



One thing that I have not been able to get to work is delete , update , insert statements. But everthing you can do in select statements in SQLite you can do with sqldf.
