If you are using summary for your summary stastics,consider using skimr.
This post introduces skimr.

<!--more-->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

When beginning to use R one of the first things to do after getting a view of the dataset you are dealing using glimpse() and str() 
is to start looking at basic descriptive statistics. In the past I used summary extensivly to do this.
I was going through a tutorial on EDA and linear regression and the author used the skimr package which I thought was a great alternative for quickly getting basic statistics. 

Personally I prefer the structure of the skimr output and how it can be customised for your own needs. 


## Why use Skimr

* It has a wider array of statistics than summary
* Returns a skim_df object which can be used with dplyr pipeline's and tidyverse functions
* Includes a sparkline if wanted with either a bar or line.
* Splits data types into separate sections
* Allows creating your own statistics with skim_with()
* Built in support for strings, lists and other column classes.


## Some examples


In the examples to follow I use different tidyverse verbs and different methods of displaying data.


### Default output 

Below is the default output from the command when run on a dataset. I will use the mpg dataset.
Below the output is separated into a summary section and then split by variable types being character and numeric in this instance.
Note the inclusion of spark lines and some additional statistics not included in summary() function.


```{r load package,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

``` {r basic_out}
skim(mpg)

```


### What did we return ?

Because skim returns a skim_df object this is pipeable and open to additional manipulation.
Looking at the structure of the skim_df we can get an orientation of how it's made up.
I use to_long in the below to get a look at skim_type, skim_variable and stat.

Looking at the below n_missing and complete_rate are base skimmers. The rest are type-base skimmers and we need
to use the skim_type prefix to refer to the correct column.


``` {r structure_of_df}

to_long(skim(mpg,model,hwy)) %>% select(skim_type,skim_variable,stat) %>% arrange(skim_type)



```


### Selecting from skim_df

Below an example of what I mean by selecting type based and base skimmers.
Note n_missing is our base skimmer and numeric.mean and character.n_unique are our type-based skimmers.


``` {r structure_selecting_the_df1}

skim(mpg) %>% select(skim_type,skim_variable,n_missing,numeric.mean,character.n_unique)

```


### Selecting specific columns from our data

Only specific columns can be selected if desired. Note there are many ways to do this. We can also use pipe and select.


``` {r select}

skim(mpg,hwy)

```


### Skim after grouping data

We can use grouping and display the relevant information by group. Note below how pipe and group_by is used.

``` {r select group}

mpg  %>% group_by(drv) %>%  skim(hwy)  

```


### Excluding charts

If you dont want the charts.You can use skim_without_charts.


``` {r select woc}

skim_without_charts(mpg) %>% filter(skim_variable == "hwy")

```


### Select only the sections we want to see using yank


If we only want to see the numeric section we can yank that section.  

``` {r select yank}

mpg %>% skim() %>% yank("numeric")

```


### Specify your own statistics using skim_with and sfl


Using skim_with we can specify our own statistics.For example we can make use of R's stat package.
Note the default functionality is to append your statistics to the default output statistics that skim returns. By selecting append = FALSE we only return the statistics we specify.

``` {r select myskim}

my_skim <- skim_with(numeric = sfl(iqr = IQR, mad = mad, p99 = ~ quantile(., probs = .99)),
  append = FALSE)

my_skim(mpg,hwy)
```


We can also exclude statistics we don't want. Note below we set P25 and P75 to NULL. Note we didn't specify append = FALSE so our addition of IQR gets appended to the default output. 

``` {r select myskimremove}

my_skim <- skim_with(numeric = sfl(iqr = IQR, p25 = NULL, p75 = NULL))


my_skim(mpg,hwy)


```





### Keep the original data set with skim_tee

We can also use skim_tee() to return the original data after running skim

``` {r select skim_tee}

mpg_tee <- mpg %>% skim_tee()  


```

``` {r select head_tee}

head(mpg_tee) 


```


## Issues encountered

The one issue I encountered was with the spark lines. If you look at the skim_tee example the sparklines are 
displayed as <U+2587><U+2586><U+2586><U+2583><U+2581> for example.

Looking at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/readme/README.html the reason given is as follows 
" This longstanding problem originates in the low-level code for printing dataframes.

while skimr can render the histograms to the console and in RMarkdown documents, it cannot in other circumstances. This includes:

* converting a skimr data frame to a vanilla R data frame, but tibbles render correctly
* in the context of rendering to a pdf using an engine that does not support utf-8."

In these caes we can use the skim_without_charts as detailed above.
